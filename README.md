## PyReport
This is a simple python script that generates a report from a given text file. The script reads the text file and generates a report based on the word count of each word in the text file. The report is then saved in a text file with the name of the input file appended with "_report".

### Usage
To use the script, simply run the following command in the terminal:
```
python PyReport.py <input_file>
```
Where `<input_file>` is the path to the text file you want to generate a report for.
